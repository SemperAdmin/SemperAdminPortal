## Notes

1. **Commander sub-items**: Many of these are detailed breakdowns of topics already covered in parent pages (like `CommandAuthorityContent`). Consider whether they need separate pages or should remain as sub-sections within the parent.

2. **Life Events**: These are high-priority for all users and should be comprehensive step-by-step guides.

3. **System links** (MOL, DTS, MCTFS): These are intentionally placeholder as they link to external systems. Consider adding brief "how to use" guides or just removing them from navigation.
